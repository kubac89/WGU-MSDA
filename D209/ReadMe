D209 Data Mining I Course Description

Data Mining I expands on predictive modeling into nonlinear dimensions, enhancing the capabilities and effectiveness of the data analytics lifecycle. 
In this course, learners implement supervised models—specifically classification and prediction data mining models—to unearth relationships among 
variables that are not apparent with more surface-level techniques. The course provides frameworks for assessing models’ sensitivity and specificity. 

D208 Predictive Modeling is a prerequisite to this course.

COURSE OBJECTIVES

- Classification Data Mining Models
The graduate applies observations to appropriate classes and categories using classification models.

- Predictive Data Mining Models
The graduate implements prediction data mining models to find hard-to-spot relationships among variables.

- Data Mining Model Performance
The graduate evaluates data mining model performance for precision, accuracy, and model comparison.
