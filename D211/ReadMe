D211 Advanced Data Acquisition Course Description

Advanced Data Acquisition enhances theoretical and SQL skills in furthering the data analytics life cycle. This course covers advanced SQL operations, 
aggregating data, and acquiring data from various sources in support of core organizational needs. 

The prerequisite for this course is D210 Representation and Reporting.


COURSE OBJECTIVES

- Explore Data
The graduate explores data acquisition.

- Advanced SQL Operations
The graduate applies advanced SQL operations to integrate multiple data sources.

This project uses the same datasets as D210: Representation and Reporting. The conclusions drawn from the data were very similar. 
The data for D210 was cleaned and prepped in ProstgreSQL instead of Jupyter Notebook,
and the Tableau dashboard was created by connecting the SQL database to Tableau instead of using static Excel files for data sources. 

I was unable to load my dashboard to Tableau public due to the large file size. Instructions for installing the dashboard and the required ZIP files 
are included in the submission.
