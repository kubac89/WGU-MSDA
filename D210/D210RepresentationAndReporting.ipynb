    "### B1. Purpose and Function of Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "The WGU churn data comes from a fictional telecommunications company like Comcast and AT&T. The dataset contains information about customer demographics and what service offerings customers have purchased. The Telco data set contains similar customer information and information about services offered. Telecommunications companies seek to minimize churn, or customers discontinuing service. I put myself in the position of a marketing analyst at WGU Churn, a company who just purchased Telco Telecommunications. I was looking at both datasets to create an ad campaign with promotions targeted at preventing current customers from churning as well as enticing new customers to sign up for service. \n",
    "I wanted to get an understanding of the customer demographics from both companies. What percentage of customers from both companies are married or have children? What is the average monthly bill of customers who churned versus customers who continue service? Could offering a loyalty discount to long term customers reduce churn?\n",
    "My first dashboard is dedicated to customer demographics. My second dashboard was dedicated to monthly charge, my first key performance index. My last dashboard was dedicated to tenure, my second key performance index.\n"

    "\n",
    "The Telco data set provided context for the values in the WGU churn data set. I had no idea if certain values were normal for telecommunications company. Telco’s Tenure and Monthly Charge data were especially revealing. Telco customers had lower monthly bills, but much longer tenure compared to the WGU customers. Someone with a profit mindset may attempt to sell WGU customers more service add ons to increase revenue, but Telco’s data tells a different story. Customer retention can be more profitable in the long run compared to short term customers who have large monthly bills. \n"

    "### B3. Explanation of Data Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "I used pie charts numerous times in my Tableau story Customer Demographics page. One visualization that aided in decision making was a pie chart communicating if WGU customers had children or if they did not have the children. The pie chart represented binary yes and no data. The chart legend demonstrated orange represented, “yes, customers have children” while blue represented, “no customers do not have children.” The chart revealed 75% of WGU customers had children. This is valuable information for a marketing team who could create ads targeted at customers with children to promote new service offerings.\n",
    "I also used stacked bar graphs in my Tableau story. The stacked bar graph visualizing if Telco customers had children in relation to their tenure length in the KPI: Tenure dashboard was very useful for business decisions. The bar had two columns on the x-axis, one representing, “Yes, the customer had children” and the other representing, “No, the customer does not have children.” The y-axis represented the average tenure in months. I created a calculated field establishing a tenure threshold of 24 months. All values below 24 months of tenure did not meet the threshold while all values above the 24 months met the threshold. Values that were below the threshold were colored orange while values that were above the threshold were colored blue. The graphs demonstrated Telco customers had the highest percentage of customers above the 24-month threshold. Additionally, Telco customers with children had the longest tenure of all the customers in the data set. Managers could use this to offer perks and incentives to entice Telco customers with children to sign up for services such as a kid-friendly streaming tv service.\n"

    "I created a gender filter that was used in the Customer Demographics, KPI: Monthly Charge, and KPI: tenure pages of my Tableau story. The gender filter contained check boxes for Male, Female, Nonbinary, and All. Selecting and deselecting the boxes changed the visuals and the counts to reflect data for that gender. For example, checking the “female” box in the gender filter on the Customer demographics page returned martial information, children information, information on customer churn, and customer gender identity for females only. The pie charts and counts for marital information, children information, and churn information would be altered to reflect the information for female customers, while the gender pie charts would look a filled in circle displaying the total counts for the WGU and Telco gender data columns. \n",
    "Additionally, I created a churn filter that was used in the Customer Demographics, KPI: Monthly Charge, and KPI: tenure pages of my Tableau story. The churn filter contained check boxes for Yes, No, and All. Selecting and deselecting the boxes changed the visuals and the counts to reflect data for if customers churned from WGU and Telco or not. For example, checking the “Yes” box in the churn filter on the Customer demographics page returned martial information, children information, gender identity, and churn information only for customers who churned. The pie charts and counts for marital information, children information, and gender identity would be altered to reflect the information for customers who churned, while the churn pie charts would look a filled in circle displaying the total counts for the WGU and Telco churn data columns. \n"

    "In the Customer Demographics page of my Tableau story, pie charts containing marital information revealed Telco half of Telco customers were married, but only 20% had children. This guided the imaginary marketing team into creating ads promoting Telco services to customers targeted at married individuals without children. \n",
    "In the KPI: Monthly Charge page of my Tableau story, the stacked bar graphs revealed that WGU customers pay nearly twice the amount as Telco customers on their monthly charge. While this is positive from a revenue perspective, using the Churn filter revealed that all customers who churned had a bill of over $100. This guided my imaginary marketing team scenario into focusing on ads that would incentivize WGU customers to sign longer contracts instead of promoting new service add ons that would increase their bills. \n"

    "According to Catharine Cote Harvard business school, creative an imaginary scenario like a real-life scenario the audience may experience will grab and keep their attention (Cote, 2021). I followed this advice by creating a scenario where the audience was on the lead marketing analytics team for WGU Telecommunications after acquiring Telco Telecommunications in a merger. The audience needed to evaluate customer data for both WGU and Telco by using my Tableau story.\n",
    "Establishing conflict and ending with a resolution for the conflict will keep the audience engaged throughout a presentation (Cote, 2021). I established conflict by stating the audience needed to come up with a marketing plan for both WGU and Telco to address key performance indicator issues. The conflict was resolved, and ad campaign ideas were presented on the last slide of my Tableau story.\n"
